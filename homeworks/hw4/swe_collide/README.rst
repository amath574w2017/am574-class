Two colliding 2-shocks
------------------------------------------

1d Shallow water equations with initial data consisting of two 2-shocks,
which collide and produce a 1-rarefaction and 2-shock.
    
Example [book/chap13/collide] to accompany the book 
`Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems
<http://www.clawpack.org/book.html>`_
by R. J. LeVeque.  This illustrates the solution shown in Figure 13.19.

Converted to Clawpack 5.4 form in 2017.
