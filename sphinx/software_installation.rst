Downloading and installing software for this class
=============================================================

See :ref:`smc` for some information on using SageMathCloud as an alternative
to installing software on your own computer.

.. _install_git:

Git
---

We will use the Git version control language for various purposes:

- To distribute computer code and other materials through the class
  repository,
- To make sure you have an up-to-date version of Clawpack, which might
  be updated during the quarter. 
- To submit homework.
- To collaborate with other students on a class project.

There are many resources for learning to use Git.  You might start with 
the GitHub `Set Up Git <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/>`_
page, which includes information on how to install it.

The `Software Carpentry lessons
<https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>`_ cover the basics pretty well.

The `Clawpack Developers' Guide <http://www.clawpack.org/developers.html>`_
has some information about our standard development procedure with Git.

See :ref:`class_repos` for information on cloning the class repository.

.. _install_clawpack:

Clawpack
--------

We will use Clawpack extensively in this class.  

A new version will be released before the quarter starts, so you might hold
off on installing for now.

.. _install_fortran_python:

Fortran and Python
------------------

A recent version of `gfortran` or other Fortran compiler should be fine.

We will use Python 2.x (not 3.x).  I recommend the 
`Anaconda distribution <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_
of Python 2.7 since this contains a long 
`list of packages <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs.html>`_,
including the latest version of the IPython notebook, matplotlib, etc.
