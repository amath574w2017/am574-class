Course Projects
==============

Students should work in groups of 2 
to tackle a project related to the topics of this course.
See :ref:`project_topics`.


I will require working with someone from a different department
in order to maximize the amount you can learn from one another.
Registered students can see `this Canvas page
<https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1096947/pages/group-projects>`_ for
a list of students in the class.

Also, try to pick a project on a topic you don't already know a lot about!

Each project will consist of a brief writeup of what you investigated
(perhaps 10 pages maximum, plus relevant computer code).
See :ref:`paper`.

Each group will also give a short presentation (20 minutes) to the class so
that you can hear about what others did.  See :ref:`presentation`.

A project should involve reading and understanding at least one journal
article.  

Groups will use GitHub to collaborate on projects.

.. _peer_review:

Feedback and peer review
-------------------------

Each group will be paired with another group for the purpose of giving
feedback on both a draft of the paper and slides for the presentation.

See :ref:`paper` for some hints on how to structure your paper and give
other groups feedback on theirs.

The goal is to help each other out, not to grade or pass judgement, so focus
on constructive feedback.  Another objective is to help you learn more about
at least one topic another group is working on, and perhaps to
improve your own paper or presentation by getting ideas from looking
at what other groups are doing.

.. _paper:

The course project paper
-------------------------

The paper for your project should be 10 pages max, plus computer code.
Code should be submitted to GitHub.

In writing the paper and when giving feedback to your partner group on their
paper, it would be good to keep the following guidelines in mind:

* Write the paper so it is structured like a journal article, e.g. start
  with a brief abstract and include introduction and conclusions
  sections.

* The paper should be reasonably focused.  You might want to explore several
  aspects of a problem, and find that 10 pages won't be enough to
  explore them all in detail.  It's ok to concentrate on one or two aspects
  in the paper and then include a list that briefly summarizes other things you
  explored.

* The paper should be understandable by others in the class even if they 
  haven't read all the papers you have on your topic.  You can assume the
  reader will have this class and the textbook as background 
  (so you don't need to 
  take up space repeating things covered in class or the text) 
  but if you discuss new
  concepts or terms not covered in class, make sure you define things 
  so the paper makes sense (to your partner group in particular) without
  having to track down the references.

* Take some care in selecting figures for the paper that best illustrate
  the topic and the results of any computer experiments you do. As in
  a journal article, you don't have space to include every figure you
  might produce, so make sure every figure you do include is there for a
  reason.

There are many resources available online to help in writing a paper and in
formulating feedback. 

Some examples:

* A general rubric for research papers:
  `http://course1.winona.edu/shatfield/air/research%20paper%20rubric.pdf
  <http://course1.winona.edu/shatfield/air/research%20paper%20rubric.pdf>`_

* This rubric for grading scientific reports also has a page on oral
  presentations :
  `http://course1.winona.edu/shatfield/air/Science_Rubrics.pdf
  <http://course1.winona.edu/shatfield/air/Science_Rubrics.pdf>`_

* "Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences", 
  by N. J. Higham.  Available as an 
  `ebook <http://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719550>`_ 
  from SIAM.

You are also welcome to write one or more IPython notebooks to discuss the
problem and illustrate results.  In fact the writeup could be presented as a
notebook if this makes most sense.  If you want to try this, you might get
some ideas from...

- `Gallery of interesting notebooks
  <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-and-IPython-Notebooks>`_


.. _presentation:

Presentations
-------------------------

Presentations should be 20 minutes long.  

Try to structure the presentation so that it can be given jointly by the
group, e.g. each person talking about some aspect of the project.

As with the paper, don't feel like you have to cover everything you did in
the presentation.  It might be best to cover the most interesting aspect or
two in enough detail that everyone can follow and learn something new and
interesting from the talk, and then summarize other things you looked at.

**Possible topics:**
See :ref:`project_topics`.
