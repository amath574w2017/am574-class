Running notebooks on your computer
----------------------------------

The `$AM574/notebooks` directory (see :ref:`class_repos`) contains some
notebooks developed for this class.  You should be able to run them on your
computer if you have Jupyter installed (see `jupyter.org
<http://jupyter.org/>`_), after starting the jupyter server
using this command from the bash shell::

    $ jupyter notebook

and then navigate to the page indicated with a browser, e.g. running the
command above might produce this message::

    The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/

Viewing notebooks on Github
---------------------------

You can also view these notebooks from:
    
  - https://github.com/amath574w2017/am574-class/tree/master/notebooks

Byt you will not be able to execute cells, only view the input and whatever
output was saved with the notebook.

Running notebooks on the Windows Azure notebook server
------------------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform now supports running notebooks
in the cloud.  You can sign up for a free account at
