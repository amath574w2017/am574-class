Outline and reading assignments
=============================================================

There is a lot of material to cover (see :ref:`info` for an overview of
topics and goals).  It will not be possible to cover everything in 
detail in lectures.  

The textbook [FVMHP] covers many details that will be omitted from lectures.  You
should read the relevant sections *before* lecture and come with any
questions you have about the material.

See :ref:`homeworks` for Homework schedule and assignments.
